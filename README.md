# Remove "Share with Skype"
Removes Microsoft Windows "Share with Skype" context menu entry.

Are you tired of this invasive, annoying context menu entry called "Share with Skype"? The one you didn't ask for but uninstalling Skype is not an option, because someone still wants you to use it in *- squints at calendar -* actually, does it even matter? Skype has been dead for more than half a decade because all the cool kids use <insert other software> now.
I solely created this because I wanted to see how .REG files work. Turns out it's super simple stuff and I might as well share.

# Why not just disable the context menu option in Skype settings?
lol
